Phew! 

First landing page complete. Nearly restarted the whole thing a couple of times, and did a lot of googling, but I'm pretty happy with the result! 

Hope you enjoy! :)

I think my commits are a mess and my CSS stylesheet could definitely be cleaned up. Might have a mess around with it later, but I need a break lol.

Ideally I'd like my hyperlinks to open in a new tab, but apparently there's no way of doing that (without adding it to each individual HTML link) without using Javascript which is lol, the next lesson. Maybe I'll come back and update this afterwards.

I'd also like to have text hover over my images to say what they are but I. Am. Tired.
